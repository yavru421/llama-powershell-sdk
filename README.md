# 👋 Hey there, I'm John Dondlinger (aka yavru421)

🔧 Independent software engineer, carpenter, VFX artist, and automation nerd based in Wisconsin Rapids, WI.  
🧠 I build LLM-powered tools that serve real trades—construction estimators, CLI tinkerers, drone editors, and terminal devs.  
🛠️ Creator of [Estimata-LLaMA](https://github.com/yavru421/estimata-llama), [llama-powershell-sdk](https://github.com/yavru421/llama-powershell-sdk), [Groqulator](https://github.com/yavru421/groqulator), and [VSEndless](https://github.com/yavru421/vsendless).

📌 I value clarity over hype, control over bloat, and tools that do the damn job.
